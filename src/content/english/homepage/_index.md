    Under the themes of <em>protecting the Environment, and Building Community Through Language and Technology</em>, the project aims to inform the next generation in Vietnam on ways to protect their environment. Our approach is to provide training and education about the environment for the health and well-being of the community. Instruction will be accomplished in English being the universal language as the tool in learning. Having green, clean and sustainable environment creates responsible business practices that can boost the economy. Knowledge and application of good science and state-of-the-art technology will position the country for global competition.<br/><br/>

    content: "
      <b>Objective 1:</b> Enriching the level of English and science education in universities through reading several peer-reviewed scientific publications specifically about plastic pollution, and writing manuscript review. This will open opportunity for non-science (other majors aside from science) participants to learn science and technology, and for science participants to uplift their English level into an international competence.
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Objective 2:</b> Motivating participants to learn technology, science, and business in protecting the environment by providing access to computer simulation, in-person hands-on experimentation on microbial plastic degradation, and business workshop. This will raise awareness on the impact of plastic pollution on the ecosystem, the economy, and human health.
