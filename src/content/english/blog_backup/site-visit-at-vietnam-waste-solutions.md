On August 7, at Vietnam Waste Treatment Company Limited - VWS (Binh Chanh District, Ho Chi Minh City), about 30 students from Tan Tao University visited the waste treatment model here. The group of students was very surprised with the waste treatment and recycling process as well as the modern technologies being deployed at the Da Phuoc Waste Treatment Complex of VWS Company.

On behalf of the Board of Directors, Mr. Kevin Moore, CEO of VWS Company expressed his joy in welcoming the students - the future owners of the country. Here, Mr. Kevin Moore introduced the establishment process and waste treatment process at the Da Phuoc Waste Treatment Complex (Binh Chanh District, Ho Chi Minh City) such as: leachate treatment plant, gas collection and power generation plant from landfill, recycling plant...

Currently, every day, the Da Phuoc Waste Treatment Complex receives and processes about 6,000 - 6,500 tons of waste for the city using American sanitary landfill technology. The amount of waste VWS processes each day accounts for about 70% of the total amount of waste in Ho Chi Minh City. An important part of VWS's waste treatment is recycling waste into products such as compost, electricity generation...

The tour aims to give the project students a practical look at the waste treatment process at Vietnam Waste Solutions. Mr. Kevin Moore, CEO, welcomed the delegation and introduced the company's advanced technologies, contributing to the treatment of about 10% of the country's waste such as using anaerobic technology, collecting methane gas from landfills to generate electricity, nano water filtration technology applied to treat waste water into clean water.

An important part of waste treatment is waste recycling. VWS has a 3,000m3/day water treatment plant. After treatment, leachate is used for irrigation, road washing, and garbage trucks. In addition, the company also collects methane gas to generate electricity. Currently, the company has generated electricity and used it throughout the enterprise.

In particular, the plant also collects methane gas to generate electricity, preventing this gas from being released to the outside. We have done everything, applying most of the most modern technologies at the Da Phuoc Waste Treatment Complex to treat waste most effectively while still ensuring the criteria of protecting the environment and people's health.

After that, the group of students visited the leachate treatment plant, the compost factory, the power plant that collects gas from the landfill... Ngo Thi Tu Suong, a second-year student at Tan Tao University, said that the group of students from Tan Tao University, including her, is researching a project on Biotechnology to find the most optimal solution to reduce plastic waste. "When we visited VWS Company, we were very excited, setting many goals and expectations. Coming here, I was able to learn and listen to many new sources of knowledge from the leaders of VWS Company; all the students' questions were answered thoroughly and thoughtfully by the Board of Directors of VWS Company. Through that, we have a better understanding of waste, the environment and solutions applied in real life and in study" - Tu Suong expressed.

Dr. Nguyen Thanh Dien, Head of the Department of Science Management of Tan Tao University, said that the students of Tan Tao University who visited the waste treatment model at VWS Company today were all selected and participated in the program by the US Department of State's Environmental Action Fund. This is a fund that sponsors Tan Tao University, providing scholarships for students in the Ho Chi Minh City and Mekong Delta areas. The purpose of the tour is to improve students' foreign language skills and combine it with environmental protection, especially the method of plastic decomposition.

To illustrate the theory, Tan Tao University contacted VWS Company and the Board of Directors of the Company created an opportunity for the group to learn about the waste treatment model, wastewater treatment, liquefied gas treatment to create energy... currently operating here.

After the tour, the students will return to school to write a report, as well as practice some experiments on plastic decomposition using microorganisms. These programs will help young people pay more attention to the environment, as well as find a technology suitable for Vietnam. Hopefully, this project can be expanded in the future. We also hope to be able to cooperate with VWS Company in some way in research and exchange.

“We are very honored to be warmly welcomed by the Board of Directors, to have our questions answered, and to visit and study at VWS Company. VWS Company gave a group of students from Tan Tao University a tour with a lot of practical and meaningful knowledge. We were very surprised and touched by the welcome of VWS Company's Board of Directors. We hope to bring more students to visit the waste treatment and recycling model from VWS Company” – Dr. Dien said.
