The study explored how black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens) digest low-density polyethylene (LDPE) microplastics. The experiment involved three main steps:

1. **Hatching and Culturing**: Black soldier fly eggs were hatched on a chicken feed and water mixture, supplemented with calcium propionate to prevent fungal growth, and reared for ten days.

2. **Sample Preparation**: After hatching, 0.5 grams of LDPE microplastics were prepared and added to the feed of one group of larvae, while a control group received only standard feed. Both groups were monitored over three weeks.

3. **Bacterial Isolation**: The guts of the larvae were extracted and processed to culture potential plastic-degrading bacteria using Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA).

### Conclusion

The experiment confirmed that black soldier fly larvae can effectively process LDPE microplastics. Promising microbial strains were isolated, suggesting potential applications in plastic degradation and waste management. These findings support the use of black soldier flies for mitigating plastic pollution.
