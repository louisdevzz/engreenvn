It is known that this project is one of 43 projects selected by the Citizen Diplomacy Action Fund 2024 (CDAF), the US Department of State, from many different countries.

The engreen.vn project started in June 2024 with the selection of 30 students and young lecturers from universities in the Mekong Delta and Ho Chi Minh City. Since July 2024, the project has been officially implemented online with the support of lecturers, helping participants use English and knowledge in the field of research on solutions to treat plastic waste using microorganisms. After the direct practice phase (face to face) at TTU and field trips, project members will write reports and present the research problems when participating in this project. Tan Tao University always cares and creates a favorable environment for lecturers and students to research, cooperate and develop, and effectively implement research projects, contributing to improving the training quality of the school.
