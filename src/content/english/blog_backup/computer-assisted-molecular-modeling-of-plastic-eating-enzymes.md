CDAF Team Leader 1 Prof. Meden F. Isaac\-Lam introduced three\-dimensional protein
structure as key concept in understanding the role of enzymes to biodegrade plastics.
Participants attending the lecture on August 6, 2024 include Vi Nha Tran from Can Tho
University (left), Nguyễn Thảo Trang from University of Social Sciences and Humanities
(right photo: right to left), Nguyễn Van Hai from Nong Lam University, Lương Thị Mỹ An
from Golden Gate University, and others in the computer lab at TTU. Team Lead 1
discussed the open\-source molecular modeling software Chimera, an extensible program
for visualization of molecular structures and related data developed by UCSF (University
of California, San Francisco) Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization and Informatics
(RBVI).

Team Lead 1 was assisted by Teaching Assistant Pham Thi Ngoc Han (Institute of Chemical Technology) to
demonstrate the use of Gromacs (shown above), a free and open\-source suite for molecular dynamics
and output analysis. The software provides high performance algorithmic optimizations in its codes
primarily designed for biochemical molecules such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids as well as non\-
biological systems including polymers, plastics and fluid dynamics to understand and calculate
complicated bonded and non\-bonded interactions. Protein\-substrate, as exemplified by enzyme\-ligand,
specifically, PET (polyethylene terephthalate) hydrolase\-PET degradation product, was shown as a docking
experiment wherein a partially\-degraded plastic product interacts with enzyme found to be isolated in
bacterial gut. Both Chimera and Gromacs were presented as part of the in\-person activities for the
participants to recognize the application of AI (Artificial Intelligence) in probing the biochemical
mechanism of enzymatic microbial degradation of plastic, which is one of the core objectives of our CDAF
project in providing a possible solution to the plastic pollution in Vietnam. With this activity, participants
gained knowledge regarding the best cutting\-edge technology incorporating AI platforms into biological
processes.
