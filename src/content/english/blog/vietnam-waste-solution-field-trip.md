Vietnam Waste Solution (VWS) serves as a model and a good example in maintaining an eco-friendly waste treatment facility and in optimizing energy-producing resources in Vietnam. CDAF (Citizen Diplomacy Action Fund) Project Team under the US Department of State conducted a field trip to VWS on August 7, 2024. Project Team Mentor and TTU Faculty Dr. Dien Nguyen organized the event for the CDAF participants to visit the complex and to learn about its operations in cleaning the environment in Ho Chi Minh City. CDAF visit was published in the local media.

VWS Director Kevin Moore received CDAF mentors (Prof. Meden F. Isaac-Lam and Dr. Điền Nguyễn) and participants at the waste treatment facility located at Da Phuoc Waste Treatment Complex, Binh Chanh District, Ho Chi Minh City. Mr. Moore presented the waste treatment and recycling process at the facility that receives and processes about 6.5 kilotons of waste for the city using American sanitary landfill technology.

A small herd of deer is kept in the facility to demonstrate that the spirit and views of VWS are focused on preserving plants and animals as part of human lives. Animals, plants and human beings are in harmonious relationship on this planet Earth. Our CDAF project under the US Department of State with the goal of environmental protection fits with the philosophy of VWS in promoting clean, green and sustainable ecosystem.

VWS Complex consists of a leachate treatment plant, composting, gas collection system, recycling plant including plastic, and power generation. The CDAF participants with VWS tour guide. amount of waste VWS the total amount of waste in Ho Chi Minh City. VWS staff accompanied the participants and gave a On-site medical clinic for employees. sightseeing tour around the complex. Compost plant.

VWS Water Treatment Facility uses several processes such as microbial decontamination treatment and a series of membrane filtration, ion exchange and reverse osmosis technology to improve the quality of the water by removing contaminants converting the wastewater into an effluent that can be safely released into the water cycle with an acceptable impact to the environment. Liquid waste is also separated from the solid waste using multiple pumps and pipes. A flowchart of the entire process is shown posted by the wall.

VWS staff showed CDAF visitors 2 flasks with a black gunky water before and a clear water after decontamination. He explained that membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are used in the facility. MBRs are combinations of membrane processes such as microfiltration and ultrafiltration with a biological wastewater treatment process (or activated sludge process). Participant Nguyễn Thị Vân Ánh asked questions to the staff about the process.

VWS Kevin Moore explained more about the maintenance and operations of the Facility after the tour. With several years on this job in Vietnam, he described VWS future plans that include improving the recycling system in the neighborhood and creating programs to educate the population and increase awareness on clean sustainable environment. VWS provides field trips to university students, international students and elementary schoolchildren, as well as Fulbright scholars, as part of its outreach projects.

Director of Operations Kevin Moore gave the participants an overview of the treatment facility. According to him, the first step involves a biological process to lower the nitrogen content, BOD and COD levels. BOD refers to biological oxygen demand and is related to the amount of oxygen matter present, while COD pertains to nonbiodegradable organic matter in the wastewater. Next step is microfiltration and nanofiltration. The residue or reject is then placed into a decanter (a spinning drum) to separate the wastewater leachate. The concentrated solid collected after separation from the liquid is transferred into a landfill. Some solids are sent to an incinerator. BOD/COD ratio changes over time and depends on the season (wet or dry). Wastewater in Asia has a higher total nitrogen content than other countries. He also mentioned that plastic is a complex compound and it is getting harder and harder to break down. He wants single-use plastic to be banned (like smoking). CO2 is managed by photosynthesis, but not methane gas. Coconut is a green source of carbon and crushed coconut shells are used to clean water. He finished with the notion that he will always have a job because there is always going to be waste anyway. Lots of money in garbage!

CDAF participants, specifically, Nguyễn ThịVân Ánh, Trần Minh Hiên, Lê Nguyễn Bình and Nguyễn Xuân Quỳnh Như, were engaged in the discussion asking Mr. Kevin Moore about the VWS bioreactors, biohazard waste treatments, and plastic waste.


CDAF faculty mentors sincerely appreciate the openness that Director Kevin Moore and his staff provided to make this field trip an enjoyable learning experience for the participants, the future generation of Vietnam. Unlike other companies in the locality, VWS is transparent and shares with the community its concept of making Vietnam clean and safe. CDAF Project Leader 1 (Prof. Meden F. Isaac-Lam) would like to acknowledge Director Kevin Moore for implementing US technology and applying an American brand in Vietnam. Vietnam Waste Solution is giving everyone hope and optimism that it is possible to make Vietnam clean.
