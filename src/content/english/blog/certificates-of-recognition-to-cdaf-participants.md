All participants were very well\-engaged in our CDAF Program during the summer of 2024\. A Certificate of
Participation was given to each participant who completed the program. Additionally, Certificates of
Recognition were awarded to three student participants who demonstrated outstanding performance
during the workshop. Criteria for selection are based on English level (oral and written communication
skills), written proposal to remediate pollution in Vietnam, scientific manuscript of the hands\-on
experimentation on microbial plastic degradation, virtual presentation on plastic pollution, interactions
with mentors and peers during in\-person activities, active participations (virtual and in\-person),
motivations, career goals, and potential for success. The CDAF Project Team recognized the achievements
of our student participants listed below.
