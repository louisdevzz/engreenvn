The ENGREENVN 2024 project is one of 43 projects selected from many different countries by the US Department of State's Citizen Diplomacy Action Fund 2024 (CDAF). Vietnam is honored to have two projects selected. Notably, both projects are the result of collaboration between lecturers, alumni of Tan Tao University and an international expert.

The ENGREENVN 2024 project started in June 2024 with the selection of 30 students and young lecturers from universities in the Mekong Delta and Ho Chi Minh City. Since July 2024, the project has been officially implemented online with the support of lecturers, helping participants use English and knowledge in the field of research on solutions to treat plastic waste using microorganisms. Next, after the direct practice phase at TTU, the project members wrote reports and presented the research problems when participating in this project.

Tan Tao University always cares about and creates a favorable environment for lecturers and students to research, cooperate and develop, and effectively implement research projects, contributing to improving the training quality of the school.
