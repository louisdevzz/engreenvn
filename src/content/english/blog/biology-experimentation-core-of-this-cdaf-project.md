Dr. Quang Ta Van showed eggs to be hatched. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) as the plastic samples were weighed to
be combined with the larvae from Black soldier fly ( H. illucens) for biodegradation.

An illustration of the Experimental Protocol below was taken from each of the manuscripts submitted on August 10, 2024 by participants Nguyễn ThịVân Ánh (Lecturer, Environmental Technology, Nong Lam University) and Võ Thị Minh Thão (Researcher, Environmental Technology, Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City). Manuscript writing of the lab component is part of the required activities for completion of the CDAF workshop. Prof. Meden F. Isaac-Lam provided feedback for every manuscript submitted by all 25 participants.

PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND PROGRESS REPORT
- Currently setting up multiple trials to optimize lab experimental procedure and confirm results.
- Participant Nguyễn Trọng Nhân (Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology) is doing research to degrade plastic using visible light.
- TTU team (students: Nguyen Thi Thuy Linh and Truong Thi Hoai Mong, CDAF mentor Dr. Nguyễn Vũ Hiếu Trung, and CDAF staff Võ ThịNgọc Thanh) won First Prize at the 5th Innovative Start-Up Competition, Long An Province to process agricultural waste using Black soldier fly. This project (BioFeed Tan Tao – A breakthrough in Sustainable Agriculture) was inspired by the CDAF workshop.

This idea utilizes Black soldier fly larvae to provide livestock feed whileeffectively addressing environmental issues at a reasonable cost promoting a circular economy model. With support from various departments at Tan Tao University, including Biotechnology, Economics, and Information Technology, the team has continuously improved the product and enhanced its competitiveness through potential partnerships with businesses in the Tan Duc CDAF mentor Dr. Nguyễn Vũ Hiếu Trung Industrial Park. with TTU students Truong Thi Hoai Mong and Nguyen Thi Thuy Linh.


FUTURE DIRECTIONS:
- Investigate other microbial enzymes to degrade other kinds of plastic products.

- Possibility of submitting a grant proposal (national or international) to continue the project.
